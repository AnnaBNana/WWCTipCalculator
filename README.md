# WWCTipCalculator
The beginning of a tip calculator.

Before we add in the logic, we set up how we would like our tip calculator to look!

Using auto-layout, we can set up our different parts of our tip calculator.
The display at the top will eventually be where the price of the bill is displayed, depending on user input.
Below, we have the tip percentages, what the tip will be, and the total amount to pay including tip.
Finally, we have the calculator key pad.

For our next session, we will add the logic so that the calculator displays the user input and outputs the results.
